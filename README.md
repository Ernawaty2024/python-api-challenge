# PYTHON - API CHALLENGE

## Overview
This project consists of two main parts: WeatherPy and VacactionPy. The objective is to analyze weather data from over 500 cities worldwide and use this data to plan potential vacaion destinations. We will utilize various Python libraries such as citypy, OpenWeatherMap API, Geoapify API, and geoViews to gather, visualize, and analyze the data. 

### PART 1 :  WeatherPy

In  this deliverable, Python script is created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. This part involves  retrieving weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and visualizing the relationships between different weather variables and latitude.

### PART 2 : VacationPy

In VacationPy, the weather data from WeatherPy is used to plan vacations based on ideal weather conditions. Interactive map visualizations is created to identify suitable vacation destinations and find nearby hotels using the Geopify API.

## Key Components:
### WeatherPy
1. **Retrive Weather Data**: Use the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for over 500 cities.
2. **Visualize Data**: Create scatter plots to show the relationships between:
    - Latitude and Temperature
    - Latitude and Humidity
    - Latitude and Cloudiness
    - Latitude and Wind Speed
3. **Linear Regression Analysis**: Compute linear regressions for the above relationships, separating data into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

### VacationPy
1. Create City Map: Display a map with points representing each city, with the size of each point indicating the city's humidity.
2. Filter Ideal Conditions: Narrow down the cities to those with ideal weather conditions based on specified criteria.
3. Find Nearby Hotels: Use the Geopify API to locate the nearest hotel within 10,000 meters of each city's coordinates.
4. Interactive Map: Create an interactive map displaying the cities with hover messages showing the hotel name and country.

## How to Use
### Weather Py
1. **Setup**: Ensure the required Python libraries are installed:
     - citipy
     - requests
     - matplotlib
     - numpy
     - scipy
     - pandas
     - jupyter
2. **Run WeatherPy.ipynb**:
    - Open the 'WeatherPy.ipnyb' Jupyter notebook.
    - Follow the steps to retrieve weather data for the cities.
    - Generate scatter plots to visualize the relationships between weather variables and latitude.
    - Perform linear regression analysis for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.
3. **Analyze Results**: Interpret the scatter plots and linear regression results to understand the relationships between latitude and various weather variables.

### VacationPy
1. **Setup**: Ensure the required Python libraries installed:
    - geoviews
    - hvplot
    - pandas 
    - requests
2. **Run VacationPy.ipynb**:
    - Open the 'VacationPy.ipynb' Jupyter notebook.
    - Load the weather data from Part 1.
    - Create a map displaying points for each city with sizes representing humidity.
    - Filter the cities based on ideal weather conditions.
    - Use the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels for the filtered cities.
    - Generate an interactive map with hover messages showing hotel names and countries.
3. **Plan Vacations**: Use the interactive map to identify potential vacation destinations and nearby hotels based on your ideal weather conditions.
